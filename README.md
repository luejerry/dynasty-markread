# Dynasty Mark Read

This userscript visually marks chapters in your Read and To Read lists on all site views.

## Compatibility note
Since version 2.4, an updated browser with support for [ES8 async-await](https://caniuse.com/#feat=async-functions) is required. Your browser must be at the following versions or newer:

| Browser | Version | Released |
|----|----|----|
| Firefox | 52 | Mar 6, 2017 |
| Chrome | 55 | Nov 30, 2016 |
| Safari | 10.1 | Mar 26, 2017 |
| Edge | 15 | Apr 10, 2017 |

If you wish to use this script with an unsupported browser version, remove the current version of the script and install the [**legacy**](https://github.com/luejerry/dynasty-markread/raw/legacy/dynastymarkread.user.js) version. The legacy script requires only ES6 support and will receive no further updates.
